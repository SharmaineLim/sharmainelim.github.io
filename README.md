# [sharmainelim.github.io](https://sharmainelim.github.io)

This is my personal site, made for funsies.

## Set up for local development

Right now, this site is made up of simple HTML pages.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

All commits pushed to the `main` branch will trigger the deployment workflow,
which will:

- build any static files, then
- copy built files into the branch that Pages use.
