# Front-end Tooling

## Requires

This project requires the following to be installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): version 18

## Running the tooling locally

1. Install Node.js.
   To install node on the host machine, we recommend using the
   [Fast Node Manager (`fnm`)](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) (or the
   [Node Version Manager (`nvm`)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).)

   Once you have it installed, simply run `fnm install` to install and activate
   the version of node required for the project.

   Refer to the [fnm documentation](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm/blob/master/docs/commands.md)
   for more details about available commands.

1. Install the npm dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Run `npm run dev` to build development assets and run the server using vite.
